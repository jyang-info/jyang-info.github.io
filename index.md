### Introduction

I am interested in the possibility of extraterrestrial life in our solar system and how we might detect it. I earned my Master's degree in Polar Science at University of Science and Technology, Korea and B.E in Bioengineering and B.S in Molecular Biotechnology at Yonsei University and Jeju National University.

Below are my research experience
