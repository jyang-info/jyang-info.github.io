### Introduction

I am deeply interested in investigating the possibility of extraterrestrial life in our solar system (e.g., Mars, Venus, Europa) and how we can detect it. My research interests include interdisciplinary approaches that integrate remote sensing (via rovers, drones, and satellites), spectroscopy, AI algorithms, data science, and geochemical and biochemical analysis. 

I completed my Master's degree in Polar Science (with a focus on Remote Sensing and Polar Biology) from the University of Science and Technology (UST), Korea, and hold a B.E. in Bioengineering and a B.S. in Molecular Biotechnology from Yonsei University and Jeju National University, respectively. I am still highly motivated to explore new methodologies, learn new disciplines, and contribute to research areas beyond my previous experience. I view unfamiliar techniques not as obstacles, but as opportunities for growth and collaboration.

### Experience
Below is an overview of my research experience and a full list of my academic materials, including a journal publication and conference presentations. Please note that some PDF files have been excluded, but they are available upon request.

**Graduate Student & Postgraduate Researcher**  
Korea Polar Research Institute  
May 2020 - June 2024

Role: I worked at the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI, <a href="https://eng.kopri.re.kr/" target="_blank">https://eng.kopri.re.kr</a>). My research focused on understanding and monitoring the changes in the Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems caused by global warming. My responsibilities include data collection, analysis, statistical evaluation, and interpretation under the supervision of Dr. Yoo Kyung Lee and Dr. Junhwa Chi.
