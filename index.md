### Introduction

I am deeply interested in the potential for extraterrestrial life in our solar system (e.g., Mars, Europa) and how we can detect it. My research interests include interdisciplinary approaches that integrate remote sensing (via rovers, drones, and satellites), spectroscopy, AI algorithms, data science, and geochemical and biochemical analysis. 

I earned my Master's degree in Polar Science (with a focus on Remote Sensing and Polar Biology) from the University of Science and Technology (UST), Korea, and hold a B.E. in Bioengineering and a B.S. in Molecular Biotechnology from Yonsei University and Jeju National University, respectively. Although my academic background spans diverse fields, I am still highly motivated to explore new methodologies, learn new disciplines, and contribute to research areas beyond my previous experience. I view unfamiliar techniques not as obstacles, but as opportunities for growth and collaboration.

### Experience
Below is an overview of my research experience and a full list of my academic materials, including a journal publication and conference presentations. Please note that some PDF files have been excluded as they are in Korean, but they are available upon request.
